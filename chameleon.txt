i am a chameleon.
these jerks might not care about you
but the universe does
and that says a lot.

--by Phoebe Buffay


It's a Sunday. I don't move on Sundays.

Sometimes I may be away longer, I like this. But I'll always come back, like this.

"Where have you been?"
"Emotional hell."

"I'm full, and yet know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it."

You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill the void.
